0x02. Minimum Operations

Project Overview

This project focuses on devising an algorithm that calculates
the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number
of characters using only two operations:

Copy All and Paste. The task is to write a Python function that determines
the fewest number of operations required to end up with exactly n characters
in the file starting from a single character H.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn and apply key
algorithmic and mathematical concepts, including:

Dynamic Programming: Approach the problem by breaking it down into subproblems
		     and building up a solution.
Prime Factorization: Understand how to decompose numbers into their prime factors,
		     as this is crucial for optimizing the problem.
Greedy Algorithms: Explore how choosing the best
		   option at each step leads to an efficient solution.
Code Optimization: Learn techniques to write efficient code,
		   focusing on minimizing time complexity.

Concepts Needed

Dynamic Programming: Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
Prime Factorization: Breaking down numbers into their prime factors
		     to optimize the number of operations.
Greedy Algorithms: Choosing the optimal solution at each step to minimize operations.
Basic Python Programming: Familiarity with loops, conditionals, and functions in Python.

General Requirements

All code will be compiled/interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3.
The code must follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
All files should end with a new line.
The first line of each file should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
All files must be executable.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Code must be properly documented.
